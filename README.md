# Sales-Commissions-App
I did a refactoring of the Sales Commission application. Generally the application 
accepts as input txt or xml or html files that contain receipts information about the sales made 
by a sales representative. The user of the application can add more receipts manually using the 
graphical user interface of the application. Based on the receipts information the application 
calculates the commission to be paid to the sales representative by the clothing company. The 
application generates respective reports in txt or xml or html format. I used practices for clean
software development, refactoring techniques and design patterns. I put correct names in 
classes , reduced the code of methods and made them simpler and extended the application by 
inserting html file and exporting a report in html file. I used Eclipse and the application is 
written in java. I added the following jars: jsoup-1.17.1, commons-io-2.11.0. I made Junit 
tests for the app and in the test_input_files folder there are examples of input files in different 
formats that the user can use to insert. In the folder test_output_files there are files that are 
used in in the tests. 
In initial code folder there is the code witout refactoring that was not created from me and in the 
refactoring folder there is the code which i refactored.This project was done in collaboration with one
fellow student.
